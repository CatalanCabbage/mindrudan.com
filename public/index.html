          Hi there <br /><br />

          -- <br/><br/>

          I'm web developer and designer, located in Copenhagen.<br />
          Since as long as I can remember, I've been helping people start projects and get their ideas on the road.<br />
          That includes working in the telco, architecture, medical, digital signage, real-estate, hydrology (and more)
          industries.<br /><br /><br /><br />



          Besides that, I quite fancy running and find hardware of any kind interesting.<br />
          Drones are also something I dabble with, even though I'm not too good at flying them.<br />
          <br />
