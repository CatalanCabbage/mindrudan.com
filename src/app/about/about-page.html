    <article class="default-container about-container">
      <h2 class="about-title">Explore</h2>
      <p class="about-paragraph">I consider myself to be a combination between a perfectionist, analyst and organizer. I often give too much attention to details. This results in overwork, but I do like a challenge. Challenges have their roots in problems and problems are always where I begin. As a designer I believe that the foundation of every project is a well defined problem. As a developer I know every problem can be solved and my goal is to acomplish that in an efficient way.</p><br/><br/>

      <h2 class="about-title">Feel</h2>
      <p class="about-paragraph">It sometimes happens that I just feel my ideas are right. Think about it. It happens to all of us. If you have to take a decision that will influence your business or career, you just know what's the right thing to do. I get such a feeling with my work and when it happens - there is nothing to stop me. I become focused, motivated and ready to invest all my energy.</p><br/><br/>

      <h2 class="about-title">Love</h2>
      <p class="about-paragraph">I rarely find design that has a mind-boggling grab of my visual senses. For example, you will understand that through my eyes my own work will never seem to be impressive. If you ever designed something, you'll probably find this easy to understand. Therefore, I like to explore and find good design. We all fall in love. Some are able to just fall in love with people, some with plain objects, and some with both. I fall in love with design.</p><br/><br/>
