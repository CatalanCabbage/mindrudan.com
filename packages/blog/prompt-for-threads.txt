Create directory-like pages for user data that is of high interest. Lookup data if you want. Think yellowpages but for his niche (fintech).

We set the format, make the design.
Figure out a way to create internal links to similar pages.

We are maybe 4 mo in now.

It's out but our expectations are low.
We continue to tweak the data, the design. Page titles, meta tags, internal links.

Finally, something happens.
We're blown away.

A 5x spike out of nowhere.
