Implementing payments for [Crontap](http://crontap.com) today or going bust.

Gonna use [@lmsqueezy](https://twitter.com/@lmsqueezy) & write about my progress in this thread üëá

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>

Never used
[@lmsqueezy](https://twitter.com/@lmsqueezy) before, but had a verified account with them.

Let's see how easy it is to use.

Plan based on quick research:

- create subscription & product
- use lemon.js to integrate
- I won't integrate with BE to get this in faster
- on a successful purchase with lemon.js I'll make an API call from the FE to update status
- if it goes wrong should be fairly easy to match transaction with account
- I don't worry about cancelling
- I will manually handle that until it gets annoying.
- later I can set up a function that I call daily with [crontap.com](https://crontap.com) to update accounts that cancelled.

Or is there a low effort way to do this?
Don't want to spend time on it.

**Update**

‚úÖ added subscriptions <br/>

Regarding the cancel check above.
[@marvr\_](https://twitter.com/@marvr_)
tells me I can use sub ID & look up through the LMSQZY API.
However I still need a custom cloud function for it because I need to pause running schedules.
Will for sure postpone this & do manually initially

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Update**

Found webhook docs thanks to
[@EyuCoder](https://twitter.com/@EyuCoder)

Looks like the proper long term solution. Will stick to simple for now.
https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/api/webhooks

Done with analysis. Let's go implement! üöÄ

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Update**

First test purchase

No checks yet.<br/>
The LemonSqueezy DX was not too great tbh.

Missing React SDK, unclear how you configure lemon.js and how to get the url (share?!)

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Update**

‚úÖ Hooked up to own the db

Still missing:

- UI to show status
- UI to manage sub (I think I'll just link to LS?)

BUT forgot I was supposed to grab beers in 30 min so I will have to pause until tmrw.
Feels close, but probably better this way so I can also test it properly.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Note**

Some more feedback for
[@lmsqueezy](https://twitter.com/@lmsqueezy)

- it should be possible to get custom fields when retrieving a subscription from the API. Is there really no way to get custom fields except for webhooks?!

- would be nice to collapse the "Response" in the API docs. It could be interactive too - allow making requests right in the docs but that's more of a nice to have.

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Update the next daye**

Back at it now.<br/>
Wanted to do a simple endpoint to show if you are pro or not. Can't find a way to filter subscriptions by status :(

This will get annoying with users that have a longer history, a simple [status]=active would go a long way.

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Update**

I might be holding this completely wrong.
But in a SaaS context where it should be easier to get a list of active subscriptions based on SaaS user id (as a custom property).

/api/subscriptions?filter=[custom][user_id]=xxx&filter=[status]=active

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Update**

‚ùå I have failed

Still going to get it done, but I was lazy and it got the best of me.

So now I understand the only proper way to use this is through webhooks. And avoiding to do that has taken more time than doing it properly.

I'll do webhooks.

<ContentPieceWrapper>
What happened?
I thought I can use a simple SDK that handled everything for me. That I didn't need to store anything in my own DB.

That ofc would have coupled me with LS both data & uptime-wise but I was fine with that if it saved me a bunch of dev time.

I had to do it the proper way instead.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
Which is: use webhooks to sync LemonSqueezy order & subscription data with my own DB.

Any clever way to test webhooks locally? Asking for a friend üòû

No? We'll I guess I'll just do it in the blind and deploy. When did that ever go sideways.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
**Update**

I've dug a hole in my hole.
Now I am a lot further from where I was last afternoon ü§£

‚úÖ bought a new domain for tunneling<br/>
‚úÖ set up cloudflare tunnel<br/>
‚úÖ verified X-Signature hash<br/>
‚úÖ created TS models for LS webhook evts<br/>
‚úÖ deleted prev code üòÉ

tomorrow is another day
