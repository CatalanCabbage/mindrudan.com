Opened my friend's Google Search console again. This is not normal by any SEO standards. Or is it? Has someone ever experienced this?

A bunch of pages were indexed (albeit a small percentage of total we have in the sitemap).

Impressions skyrocketed overnight. But most importantly, the CTR went up too!<br/>
Might be on to something here. üßê
