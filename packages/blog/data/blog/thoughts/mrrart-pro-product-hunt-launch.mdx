I'm always launching too late or not at all.<br/>
Think I need to fix a few more things before it's delightful enough.<br/>
It took [@aliszu](https://twitter.com/@aliszu) to hunt me to get me off my butt.<br/>
So now I'm launching more.<br/><br/>
MRRArt will be on [ProductHunt](https://producthunt.com/products/mrrart-pro) 15th of July. Get notified about the launch [here](https://producthunt.com/products/mrrart-pro).
Hope you'll be there! ðŸ«¶

I've made this a promo video with [clippulse.com](https://clippulse.com) and it was super easy.

The wonderful
[@andrei_terteci](https://twitter.com/andrei_terteci)
was kind to reach out and offer me free credits to make a video.

This entire thing took me about 45min including giving Andrei some feedback.

It's kinda awesome!
