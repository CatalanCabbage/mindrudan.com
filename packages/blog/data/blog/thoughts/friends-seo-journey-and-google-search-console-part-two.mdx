Update on my friend's website that I helped with SEO. He said he enjoyed my advice 😃

His domain is a few years old with some external links.

I wish I could tell you exactly what worked. I have some ideas, but not sure why it exploded _now_.

We did performance work, programmatic SEO & tweaked metas (incl i18n) among others.

This is mostly due to pSEO as far as I can tell so it'll likely be harder to convert.

This is all organic btw.
Correlates with pages getting indexed.

Extras:

- We used LLMs to enrich some of the content on pSEO pages
- We generated sitemaps indexes ofc for this volume
- prior to pSEO there's been a push on creating HQ content (albeit low volume - now stopped)
