First, let's talk about follower count.
this doesn't necessarily mean much.

Depending how you get those followers, they can be users, fans of your work or even friends.

Or they can be neither.

[@sveta_bay](https://twitter.com/sveta_bay)
was talking about this the other day.

<ContentPieceWrapper>
There are accounts with tens of thousands of followers but little engagement.
Why? Because many people acquire them with clickbait threads, growth hacks etc.

Then followers are just a meaningless vanity metric.
So how did I do it? 👀

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
I tried to stay clear of all that.
the recipe for success is simple.

You know that little monkey that says "don't post this, no one cares"?
I locked that monkey in the basement.

I stopped filtering content & posting what I _thought_ people want to see and

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
posted my raw thoughts.
the way I am when I'm truly free. A bit crazy, a bit friendly, sometimes angry.

I wrote about my work, my frustrations, my wins.
Opened up more. Showed good and bad.

Replied to people.
Made jokes.

God I made so many friends here.

<ContentPieceWrapper>
The rest from what I can tell was a mix of luck, probability and hard work.
I showed up for my new friends.
I continued to share.

Some tweets went viral, some were meh.
But everyday being myself brought me closer to...

<ContentPieceWrapper>
...people that understood my journey, my struggles & my happiness.
Some days were grey. Eventually you'd feel demotivated.

What are you doing putting hours on a big corp's platform that doesn't give a 💩 about you.

But something amazing happened.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
In those darkest of days - without asking - people started to check on me.
It is going ok? How can we help?

This never happened. This doesn't happen with friends IRL.
They tweeted @ me to uplift me.

And that's why I know this is were I want to be.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
There is no other place that I know of where this happens.
You unconditionally support and are supported by brilliant, talented and hard-working makers.

I will cling to this as much as I can, because it is the best thing that happened to me on the internet. So far, at least.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
Remember.

Stop filtering your thoughts. Say what you think, not what you imagine people would like you to say.

Be yourself. Build things. Talk about it.
Be nice, be human. Share a joke.

That's the secret.

<ContentPieceWrapper>
  I am proud of those that follow me, but even more proud by the brilliant
  people that I follow. People I now know as friends ❤️
