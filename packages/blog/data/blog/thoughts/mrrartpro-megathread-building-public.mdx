afterwards I did initial research.

I went through most of unicode characters to see what works on twitter, what works in the terminal and what works in general for line characters as well as background.

having validated the feasibility, I jumped into marketing.

did the website which was received very well and made sure to credit my first (awesome) supporters!

in the meantime I started working on a PoC for the core functionality.

after I slapped a core library together, I am now working on a UI PoC.

I will first add all UI pieces I have in mind and then work on the UX.
