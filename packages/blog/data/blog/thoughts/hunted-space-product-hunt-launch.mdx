Thanks to [@aliszu](https://twitter.com/@aliszu) & [@TakoTreba](https://twitter.com/@TakoTreba) we're launching [hunted.space](http://hunted.space) on Product Hunt this Friday. Let's celebrate!

Introducing âœ¨cinematic modeâœ¨

A new, beautiful way to ðŸ‘€ top 10 charts:

- ðŸ“º optimized for wide screens & TVs
- âœ¨ auto-updates
- ðŸ“ˆ shows votes, comments & speed!

Throw this on a TV during your launch and get everyone pumped.
It's the cheerleader you didn't know you needed! :D

(I knew because [@HaiTa](https://twitter.com/@HaiTa) told me haha)
