\$7.99 one-time purchase for [Clobbr App](https://clobbr.app).<br/>
No subscription.<br/>
I decided it's not fair for users to pay a subscription for an app they'll use infrequently. This'll mean I make less $, but I don't want to be greedy.

What do you think? Is this a reasonable deal?

IMO too many apps are charging a subscription these days when they shouldn't.

It makes sense for a SaaS / cloud service but not for this kind of app.

I put myself into my users' shoes and I would be let down if this was a subscription.

Lemme know if you think different based on the AppStore listing!
