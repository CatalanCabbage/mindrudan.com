[previously, I have failed](/articles/thoughts/crontap-payments-implementation)

<ContentPieceWrapper>
I'm back at the [@lmsqueezy](https://twitter.com/@lmsqueezy) 1-day üòÇ integration. In my sleep, I saw that [apihustle.com](http://apihustle.com) will become an international conglomerate with 10s of services in one subscription to rule them all üíç.

Sharing progress as I go

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
Since apihustle will become wildly successful, I should store the payment data in a separate database so I can share subscriptions between services.

So creating an new db in
[@supabase](https://twitter.com/@supabase)
to handle that.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
Here's how the infra looks

Crontap Internal API ‚ÜîÔ∏è Crontap Scheduler<br/>
‚ÜïÔ∏è<br/>
Vercel Serverless ‚ÜîÔ∏è Auth ‚ÜîÔ∏è Crontap UI

Top part will be unchanged.
Bottom part will change to have a webhook callback serverless function that stores data to supabase.

LemonSqueezy Subscription Change ‚û°Ô∏è Vercel Webhook Callback ‚û°Ô∏è Supabase

handle a request:

Crontap UI ‚û°Ô∏è Auth ‚û°Ô∏è Vercel Serverless ‚û°Ô∏è Check sub in Supabase

‚û°Ô∏è Crontap API or <br/>
‚ùå Deny request

**Update**

Integration with
[@supabase](https://twitter.com/@supabase)
done. Now webhooks are all properly handled.

Just need to make a nice reusable check for subscribers.

Thinking:

select \* from subscriptions<br/>
where user_id=uid<br/>
and status=active<br/>
and product_id=id<br/>
and variants_id in (x,y, z, ...)

Should be good?

**Update**

It works quite quick. Having fun with it :D <br/>

Query above seemed to work fine.
Made a handy helper to check for subscriptions in any API call.

Gonna update the pricing page, test in prod & release tomorrow.

**Now, let's talk about why did I fail in the first place**

What did I want to do?

I wanted to rely on the LemonSqueezy API & do minimum effort to model & store data in my db.

I'd just store the order but wanted to rely on the LS API to get sub statuses & do checks for active subs directly instead of storing this in my own db.

</ContentPieceWrapper>

<ContentPieceWrapper>
On the flip side once I get the patterns in place it‚Äôll be fairly easy to reproduce in other products UNLESS said products use a different kind of storage.

Still think some sort of ‚Äúedge‚Äù payment integration could make sense.
I know we‚Äôre relatively spoiled complexity-wise these days even though I‚Äôm b\*thing about it but hear me out:

- You got your SDK: npm i for framework of choice
- You pass in a user ID & open a payment modal. Purchase complete.
- You got your backend SDK. Give it an api key and it can guard cloud functions like auth providers do (see auth0 etc)
- you have a backend SDK e.g. a withLemons wrapper that reads the user ID via a header. You get active subscriptions.

```js
export withLemons((req, res) => {
    const { subscriptions } = useLemons()
     ‚Ä¶
})
```

No subscription you get a 404 or whatever and the UI can handle that as it sees fit.

- no dealing with LS customer ids
- easy to switch env & test
- no webhooks needed ->
- no storage of payment data in consumer db needed

Sure that means all is delegated to LS and you have complete trust that they‚Äôll have a good uptime and keep your data safe.
You probably want to move away from that once you get bigger and ultimately switch to webhook + own DB, but I feel like now this is the only option you have if you don‚Äôt wanna resort to hacks.
