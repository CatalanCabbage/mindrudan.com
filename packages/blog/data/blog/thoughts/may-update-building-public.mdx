May update! Here's the latest on the journey:

ðŸ’¸ MRR up 100% (it was 0) <br />
ðŸ’¸ Costs up 240%<br />
ðŸ’¸ I just write $2540 so this tweet will get more engagement<br />

Tell us, Dan, what is your secret to running this company straight into the ground?

In it for the long run bois, maybe July as it looks.
