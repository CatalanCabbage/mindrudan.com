note: retweets are a sum of quotes and retweets
also note: lines inside <ContentPieceWrapper> should be broken with the <br/> tag if they are not followed by a new line.

also note: for tags, get creative and also include general categories. create at least 10 tags.
tags should use dashes instead of spaces.

finally, you will write a file name for this content, for example:
mrrart-pro-building-public-journey.mdx

reply with the file name before any other content.
make sure to use the correct date. The date is in this format: 2:08 PM Â· Jun 22, 2023. so for this input, you should use 2023-06-22

got it?
